# This Website

This website is built on [Github](https://github.com) utilising the [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) facility.

It is built using the [Just the Docs] theme. The [Getting Started] section takes you through setting up a [new Github repository] using the Just the Docs template.

Note: For an overall site template based on your repo user name, use `<username>.github.io` as the repo name - this gives the website addres as <username>.github.io. For a child site (eg. for a specific project) use `<childsite>.github.io` to get a <username>.github.io/<childsite> address.

Github Pages uses [Jekyll] to generate a static website from content you create as .md and .html files. This allows formatting with markdown, html, css, Jekyll and [Liquid] templating.

Also, for [Markdown], these [Basic Syntax] and [Extended Syntax] guides are useful.
