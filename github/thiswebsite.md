# This Website

This website is built on [Github](https://github.com) utilising the [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) facility.

It is built using the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme. The [Getting Started](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/#getting-started) section takes you through setting up a [new Github repository](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/generate) using the Just the Docs template.

Note: For an overall site template based on your repo user name, use `<username>.github.io` as the repo name - this gives the website addres as <username>.github.io. For a child site (eg. for a specific project) use `<childsite>.github.io` to get a <username>.github.io/<childsite> address.

Github Pages uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate a static website from content you create as .md and .html files. This allows formatting with markdown, html, css, Jekyll and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating.
